## ::Torus::

###### Personally created toroidal (and otherwise) equations 

###### producing a somewhat strange 2-OP FM Voice with an Additive feel. Also - DISTORTION.



A Little Circle spins on its end, while orbiting around a Big Circle laid flat. And also other stuff



###### Outputs::

* **X** - Horizontal axis of chosen orbital equation
* **Y** - Vertical axis of chosen orbital equation
* **Z** - Depth axis of chosen orbital equation

A Torus is 3D after all

###### 

###### Inputs \& Parameters::

* **Big Pitch** - controls pitch of outer winding(Big Circle) 

&nbsp;	- Input tuned to 1 V/Oct, adds to Knob

* **Little Pitch** - controls pitch of inner winding(Little Circle) 

&nbsp;	- Input tuned to 1 V/Oct, adds to Knob

* **FM** -  do Some FM Stuff! applies global pitch offset when Input disconnected

&nbsp;	- Input has associated Attenuverter

* **Drive** - Turn it up to 11 or whatever, comes in flavors!

&nbsp;	- Knob becomes Attenuator + gain for Input when connected

* **Radial Difference** - controls Size of Little Circle in respect to Big Circle

&nbsp;	- Input adds to knob and caps at limits

* **Big Windings** -number of times around Big circle for one rotation of base Pitch

&nbsp;	-  Input adds to knob and caps at limits

* **Little Windings** - number of times around Little circle for one rotation of base Pitch

&nbsp;	- Input adds to knob and caps at limits 

* **Sync** - sync Torus to another VCO! or Whatever! Hard Sync
* **Drive Type** Switch - 3 Types

&nbsp;	- Fundamental - this is essentially the drive from VCV Fundamentals VCF, nice and warm

&nbsp;	- WaveFold - 8 stages of WaveFolding

&nbsp;	- Clip - normal clipping with Fundamental flavor

* **Equation** Switch - chooses orbital equations, joyously named 'Electron', 'Folding', and 'Toroid'
* **LFO** **1** -turns Big Pitch (Big circle) into LFO (8 octaves down?)
* **LFO** **2** - does the same for Little Pitch (Little circle)
