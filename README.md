A collection of modules with a focus on the strange and mathematical,
somewhat to teach myself to Code.

Screen equipped Modules Can Currently Hog GPU drawing time a bit.



New Modules for Christmas!



**Concierge**: a master clock equipped for most any time signature you could desire,

 	including some that don't technically exist.

 	- accepts CV (0v = 120bpm) and External Clock(assumes quarter note)

 	  external clock takes running average of last 4 beats, so it takes a little bit to catch on

 	- outputs clocks from 16th notes to more than 16 measures, with lots in between

 	  as well as Phase outputs for the longer clocks



**Ledger**: Any concierge must have a ledger! - Quintuple normalled logic Blocks

 	- once both inputs for a block are connected, it becomes independent, and trickles down

 	- if the top input (of any but the first) is not connected it is normalled to NOT the top input above it

 	- if the bottom input (same) is not connected,

 	  each operation receives in its place the result of same operation from above(C AND D becomes C AND (A AND B))



**Dobbs**: Dual - Dual Envelope Generator, named after a Mountain I loved as a child

 	- Comes with Pretty Lights!!

 	- each Peak (ha) comes with cv over attack and decay as well as a fast mode that makes it real snappy

 	- each Peak comes with a twin Peak (hA) with its own attack and decay

 	- twin peaks (HA) have cv controllable start time offset relative to the main envelope

 	- each pair of Peaks has cv control over their shape(log - exponential) and an ASR Mode

 	- all four total envelopes also come with end of cycle triggers



**Onceler**: ever need something to just.. wait a while? well with the onceler you chop down Trees!

 	- feed it a gate(an Axe) and wait for it to cut the tree down.

 	- when its down the Tree will scream(give you gate) for as long as you like

 	- you can also Speak to the tree, and once you cut it down it will Talk back what you say

 	- start over anytime with Redon't. or Don't!

 	- comes with several modes for all your various waiting and screaming needs



**Shear**: A true 12 band IIR Comb Filter with insertable feedback loop, in stereo

 	- cutoff tuned 1v/oct

 	-its IIR so you can also give it a trigger and listen to it ping away

 	- emphasize even or odd harmonics, or skew the bands for more enharmonic percussive sounds

 	- shove a reverb in the feedback loop, that'll go fine trust me!

 	- better yet, put another Shear in there. chain 5!
